# AIRPORT-DATA-ANALYSIS
This airport analysis provides a comprehensive examination of airport operations, passenger trends, flight data, and key performance indicators (KPIs). The process includes series of stages, which are data processing, data cleaning ,descriptive statistic and visualization.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to uncover actionable insights from airport data to:

- Support informed, data-driven decision-making
- Improve operational efficiency across airport services
- Enhance the overall passenger experience
- Ensure compliance with safety and regulatory standards

  ## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before performing this analysis, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy, reliability, and consistency:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and filled or removed incomplete data entries to maintain data integrity.
- **Data Type Correction**: Ensured correct formatting for fields such as dates, times, numerical values, and categorical variables.
- **Outlier Detection**: Detected and treated abnormal values (e.g., extreme delays or unusually high passenger counts) to prevent skewed results.
- **Standardization**: Harmonized inconsistent entries.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Removed duplicate records to eliminate redundancy and avoid bias in analysis.
